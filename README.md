# Core
Create overlapping "core" for vessels.

Technical short: just apply the XSLT to the xml of a vessel; all blocks are moved into alignment with root block on the z-axis
Obiously; the result, if you have made all blocks of the same size; is a complete overlap of all blocks.

The XSLT,together with ship xml can be pasted into:

Rationale for license: if you modify the XSLT or use it as a service; then distribute the modified XSLT.
